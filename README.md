# Microprofile Evolution

**Before you initiate a pull request** to [microprofile-samples](https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-samples), which is used to share ideas and examples around the initiative, please read the process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on the [microprofile mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile) first.

This repository tracks the ongoing evolution of Microprofile. It contains:

* Goals for upcoming Microprofile releases (this document).
* The [Microprofile evolution process](process.md) that governs the evolution of Microprofile.

This document describes goals for the Microprofile on a per-release
basis, usually listing minor releases adding to the currently shipping
version and one major release out.  Each release will have many
smaller features or changes independent of these larger goals, and not
all goals are reached for each release.

Goals for past versions are included at the bottom of the document for
historical purposes, but are not necessarily indicative of the
features shipped. The release notes for each shipped version are the
definitive list of notable changes in each release.

## Development major version:  Microprofile 1.1
Expected release date: End of 2016

The primary goal is to identify issues faced when developing the reference infrastructure and focus on solving limited number of most important problems to narrow the focus and keep fast and steady progress.

## Latest released version: Microprofile 1.0
Release date: September 2016

The primary goal of this release is to establish a minimal common base for development of microservices with enterprise Java specifications. This should provide a base for further iterative development of the MicroProfile platform.
